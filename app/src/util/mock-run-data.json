      "output": "An LLC (Limited Liability Company) blends elements of partnerships and corporations. Owners are called members and have limited liability. It's more flexible in terms of management and operations. A corporation, on the other hand, is a separate legal entity owned by shareholders. It offers limited liability but is subject to double taxation unless structured as an S-corporation.",

      "output": "Dividends for a C-corporation are distributions of profits made to shareholders.
